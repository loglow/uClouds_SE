# µClouds SE (uClouds, microClouds) Eurorack [Rev D]

## 8HP Eurorack module | Granular audio processor

[μClouds SE](http://uclouds-se.com) is a granular audio processor that creates textures and soundscapes by combining multiple segments of sound taken from a recording buffer.

This re-engineered Eurorack module updates and simplifies the classic [Mutable Instruments Clouds](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/) design by miniaturizing the module from 18HP to 8HP and redesigning the front panel layout without eliminating any original functionality.

Fully compatible with upstream Clouds firmware. Includes power cable, mounting hardware, and a one-year warranty. Designed and built with care by [Tall Dog Electronics](http://tall-dog.com) in Western Massachusetts. Licensed [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) open source hardware.
